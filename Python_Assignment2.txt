1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
There are 2 types of boolean values and those are written as below.
1. True
2. False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
a. AND - True if both are true
b. OR - True if at least one is true
c. NOT - True only if false

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

AND Truth table:
Value1		Value2		Output
True		True		True
True		False		False
False		True		False
False		False		False

OR Truth table:
Value1		Value2		Output
True		True		True
True		False		True
False		True		True
False		False		False

NOT Truth table
Value		Output
True		False
False		True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 &gt; 4) and (3 == 5) - False

not (5 &gt; 4) - False

(5 &gt; 4) or (3 == 5) - True

not ((5 &gt; 4) or (3 == 5)) - False

(True and True) and (True == False) - False

(not False) or (not True) - True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
> - greater than
>= - greater than or equal to
< - less than
<= - less than or equal to
== - eual to
!= - not equal to

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.

assignment operator has '=' sign and equal to has '==' sign.
When we need to assign value to any variable, we use assignment operator.
If we need to compare 2 variables, we use equal to operator.

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print(&#39;eggs&#39;)
if spam &gt; 5:
print(&#39;bacon&#39;)
else:
print(&#39;ham&#39;)
print(&#39;spam&#39;)
print(&#39;spam&#39;)

Answer:
Block 1 - 
spam = 0

Block 2 -
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')

Block 3-
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

if spam == 1:
  print('Hello')

elif spam == 2:
  print('Howdy')

else:
  print('Greetings')

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
CTRL + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
A break statement, when used inside the loop, will terminate the loop and exit. If used inside nested loops, it will break out from the current loop.
A continue statement will stop the current execution when used inside a loop, and the control will go back to the start of the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
There is no difference.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while

For loop:
for i in range(10):
  print(i)

While loop:
i = 1
while(i<=10):
    print(i)
    i += 1
